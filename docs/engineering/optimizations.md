# Optimization log

**English** · [简体中文](optimizations.zh-CN.md)

Every optimization gets one entry here, newest first. The trade-off entry is
written before the change; this entry is completed after it ships. The point is
to make the *work* auditable: not only what changed, but how it was done, what
it cost, and where the chain was weak. See [`AGENTS.md`](../../AGENTS.md).

## Template

```markdown
### YYYY-MM-DD — <title>

- **Goal / hypothesis:** what should improve, and why we believe it.
- **Trade-off:** link to the entry in `docs/architecture/trade-offs.md`.
- **Change:** one paragraph plus the main files or areas.
- **Eval:** command, dataset or case ids, result before and after.
- **Execution chain:** steps, workers or tools, duration and cost, failures and
  retries.
- **Pros:** what the chain did well.
- **Cons / next time:** where it was slow, expensive, brittle, or incomplete.
- **Reversal condition:** copied from the trade-off entry.

## 2026-11-05 — Prompt provenance and offline regression gate

- **Goal / hypothesis:** make a Main Agent turn attributable to the prompt it
  actually read, and make the harness's judgment layers regression-testable
  without a live model.
- **Trade-off:** [prompt provenance](../architecture/trade-offs.md#2026-11-05--prompt-provenance-is-a-content-addressed-file-plus-a-journal-event),
  [regression gate](../architecture/trade-offs.md#2026-11-05--the-regression-gate-is-offline-per-case-and-behavior-only).
- **Change:** per-turn `main_agent.prompt_snapshot` events with charter,
  briefing, and tool-table hashes plus model/effort; content-addressed material
  under `prompt-snapshots/`; a listing endpoint; `npm run gate` with 11 verdict
  cases, 14 policy cases, 5 audit records, a per-case baseline, and a CI step.
- **Eval:** `npm run gate` — PASS (100% agreement, 0 false passes); `npm test` —
  451 tests, 448 pass, 3 skipped; `npm run typecheck` — pass. Before the gate
  there was no behavioral eval; the baseline generated in this change is the
  "before" for every later optimization.
- **Execution chain:** implemented in one session, then verified three times
  (feature commit, gate commit, post-merge). PR creation was blocked twice by
  the permission classifier and the PR was opened by hand; the base merge had a
  single `CHANGELOG.md` conflict, resolved by keeping both sides. No model calls
  and no provider time; CI is about 40 seconds per job.
- **Pros:** the gate is zero-cost, deterministic, and runs on every commit; the
  per-case baseline turns every later judgment shift into a reviewable diff.
  Prompt provenance needed no new store — the journal plus content-addressed
  files were already the right shape.
- **Cons / next time:** the first baseline encodes current behavior, so it
  cannot prove correctness — only detect change. The prompt-snapshot wiring into
  a real Pi session is covered by the tool-registration test and typecheck, not
  by an end-to-end session test (running one was blocked in the session). The
  PR/branch ceremony added two permission blocks and a conflict; the standing
  rule is now to merge to `main` directly and summarize the merge.
- **Reversal condition:** see the two trade-off entries above.
